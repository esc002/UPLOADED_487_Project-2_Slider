      <h2>What is Tokidoki?</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
          <p>Tokidoki is a fashion and lifestyle brand inspired by Japanese popular culture and art. The company was created in 2005 by Italian artist Simone Legno.
            He was first introduced to Japanese culture through anime in the 90s. "Tokidoki" means "sometimes" in Japanese, which Legno explains is because "everyone 
            waits for moments that change one’s destiny, by chance or by meeting a new person".</p>

          <h2>What is Kawaii?</h2>
          <p>"Kawaii", meaning "cute" in Japanese, has grown into a cultural movement with roots in post-war Japan. Since then, Japan has become immensely
            influential in popular culture. In addition to its marketing strength, "kawaii" has also become a movement. According to Sato's "From Hello Kitty to 
            Cod Roe Kewpie", cuteness can be subverted as a tool of self-expression and resistance. This idea is prevalent in Tokidoki's inclusion of punk
            elements and subversive designs.</p>
            <p class="d-flex justify-content-center">🌸  🌸  🌸</p>
            <p>According to Merriam-Webster Dictionary; "In Japanese, the word kawaii has a meaning that sits more or less at the juncture of "cute," "tiny," or "lovable." 
              The cute aesthetic—with its bold, nearly cartoon-like lines and rounded forms—informs a large segment of Japanese popular culture."</p>

          <h2>Tokidoki Characters</h2>
          <p>Tokidoki's franchises range from a more traditionally "kawaii" sweets-themed "Donutella", but most are less conventional like a cactus themed "Cactus Friends"
            or "punkstar". Most notable is the "Unicorno" series, which includes series of unicorn collectibles with very unique designs, many drawing from Japanese culture
            and other themes. The iconic characters decorate various products such clothing or accessories in addition to figures.

          <h2>Tokidoki Collabs</h2>
          <p>In addition to Japanese culture, some likely influences on Tokidoki include: Japanese mascots such as Hello Kitty, fashion sketch illustrations, and manga.  
            Since it's formation, Tokidoki has collaborated with countless brands in these areas including Sanrio, haute couture brands and icons, manga, conventions, and more.
            Some notable examples include Karl Lagerfeld: a fashion designer, Sanrio: the company behind Hello Kitty, and Japanese vocaloid singer: Hatsune Miku.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Overall, Tokidoki's success is indicitive of the growing popularity and marketibility of Japanese "kawaii" culture. It also represents how globalized popular culture
            and art have become, as Tokidoki continuously draws inspiration from cultures accross the globe as well. Tokidoki's increasing popularity with an older audience also
            represents how "kawaii" is not just for kids and can be used by people as a form of expression as well.
